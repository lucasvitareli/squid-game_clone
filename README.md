# 🦑 Squid Game Clone

# 

This project was developed as a way to practice some of the techniques learned in the **Front-End course by EBAC**.

It is a **clone of the Netflix website**, specifically the **landing page for the Squid Game series**. The main goal was to recreate the interface visually and interactively, simulating a real product page layout.

- 🎨 **Sass usage** – For organized and modular styling.
- 📌 **Sticky navigation bar** – The top menu stays fixed during page scroll.
- 🧩 **Template Grid Layout** – Structure built using CSS Grid.
- ⚙️ **Gulp automation** – Images, SCSS and JavaScript files are compiled and optimized via Gulp.
